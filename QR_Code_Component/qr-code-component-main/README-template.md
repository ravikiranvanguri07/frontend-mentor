### What I learned


I have developed a simple HTML page for displaying a QR code. Here's what I have learned or implemented through this development:

###### HTML Structure:
- I have structured your HTML using `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags, which is the basic skeleton of any HTML document.

###### Meta Tags:
- I have utilized `<meta>` tags for specifying character set (`<meta charset="utf-8">`) and viewport settings (`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`). This helps in ensuring proper rendering and responsiveness across different devices.

###### CSS Styling:
- I have defined CSS rules to style various elements within your HTML document.
- I have used CSS Grid (`display: grid;`) and `place-items: center;` to center the content vertically and horizontally on the page.
- Applied styling to the QR code container, including background color, padding, border radius, box shadow, etc.
- Styled the `<p>`, `<img>`, and `<h1>` elements with appropriate font sizes, colors, margins, and alignments.
- Added a class for attribution styling.

###### QR Code Image:
- I have embedded a QR code image `<img>` within your HTML, with a placeholder source (`src`). This QR code likely links to a website or resource related to frontend development.

###### Content:
- I have included a heading `<h1>` and a paragraph `<p>` providing information about the QR code's purpose, encouraging users to scan it to visit Frontend Mentor for improving their frontend coding skills.

Overall, through this development, I have practiced HTML structure, meta tags usage, CSS styling, and integrating external content (the QR code image) into your web page. Additionally, I have learned about the importance of frontend projects in improving coding skills.
