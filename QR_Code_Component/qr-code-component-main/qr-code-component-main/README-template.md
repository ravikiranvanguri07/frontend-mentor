## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a simple web page that generates a QR code, providing users with a convenient way to access a specific resource or website.

### Screenshot

(.\qr-code-component-main\screenshoots\mobile.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned


I have developed a simple HTML page for displaying a QR code. Here's what I have learned or implemented through this development:

HTML Structure: 
I have structured your HTML using <html>, <head>, and <body> tags, which is the basic skeleton of any HTML document.

Meta Tags:
I have utilized <meta> tags for specifying character set (<meta charset="utf-8">) and viewport settings (<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">). This helps in ensuring proper rendering and responsiveness across different devices.

CSS Styling:
I have defined CSS rules to style various elements within your HTML document.
I have used CSS Grid (display: grid;) and place-items: center; to center the content vertically and horizontally on the page.
Applied styling to the QR code container, including background color, padding, border radius, box shadow, etc.
Styled the <p>, <img>, and <h1> elements with appropriate font sizes, colors, margins, and alignments.
Added a class for attribution styling.

QR Code Integration:
I have embedded a QR code image (<img>) within your HTML, with a placeholder source (src). This QR code likely links to a website or resource related to frontend development.

Content:
I have included a heading (<h1>) and a paragraph (<p>) providing information about the QR code's purpose, encouraging users to scan it to visit Frontend Mentor for improving their frontend coding skills.

Overall, through this development, I have practiced HTML structure, meta tags usage, CSS styling, and integrating external content (the QR code image) into your web page. Additionally, I have learned about the importance of frontend projects in improving coding skills
